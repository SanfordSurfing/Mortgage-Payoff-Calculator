## 测试说明

### 测试覆盖范围

**Calculator 1 覆盖：**
- ✅ 正常还款（无额外还款）
- ✅ 每月额外还款
- ✅ 每年额外还款
- ✅ 一次性额外还款
- ✅ 多种额外还款组合
- ✅ 不同利率水平（高、中、低）
- ✅ 不同贷款期限
- ✅ 剩余期限包含月份的情况

**Calculator 2 覆盖：**
- ✅ 正常还款（无额外还款）
- ✅ 每月额外还款
- ✅ 每年额外还款
- ✅ 一次性额外还款
- ✅ 多种额外还款组合
- ✅ 不同利率水平（高、中、低）
- ✅ 不同贷款规模（大额、小额）

### 验证要点

1. **计算准确性**
   - 月供计算是否正确
   - 总利息计算是否正确
   - 还款期数计算是否正确

2. **额外还款效果**
   - 额外还款是否减少总期数
   - 额外还款是否减少总利息
   - 节省的时间和利息是否合理

3. **边界情况**
   - 利率为 0 的情况（如果支持）
   - 余额接近 0 的情况
   - 额外还款大于余额的情况

4. **数据一致性**
   - 原始方案和新方案的对比数据是否一致
   - 节省时间 = 原始期数 - 新期数
   - 节省利息 = 原始利息 - 新利息

### 使用方法

1. 在计算器中输入测试用例的输入参数
2. 点击"Calculate"进行计算
3. 对比实际输出与预期输出
4. 检查关键指标是否在预期范围内
5. 验证计算结果是否合理

### 注意事项

- 预期输出中的数值为近似值，实际计算结果可能有小幅差异（通常在 1-2% 范围内）
- 时间计算可能因月份天数不同而有细微差异
- 利息计算采用复利方式，结果会因计算精度而略有不同
- 如果计算结果与预期差异较大（>5%），需要检查算法实现
